# Avalanche Bootcamp Exercises

This directory contains all the exercises completed during the Avalanche Bootcamp. The smart contracts used were sourced from OpenZeppelin and other resources. This repository aims to showcase the completion of all activities and the application of various Avalanche and blockchain technologies.

## Smart Contracts

- Several smart contracts were obtained from OpenZeppelin:
  - **ERC20**: For creating and deploying fungible tokens.
  - **ERC721**: For creating and deploying non-fungible tokens.

## Tools Used

- **AVAX Tokens**: Tokens for the Fuji testnet were obtained from this faucet: [Avalanche Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c)
- **Core Wallet**: Primarily used to manage accounts and interact with the Avalanche blockchain.
- **Remix**: Used for writing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Snowtrace**: Used to view the status of transactions on the testnet: [Snowtrace Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)
- **Chainlist**: Used to add the Fuji testnet to the wallet: [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)

## Deployed Smart Contracts

- **ERC20 Token Contract**: Deployed on the Fuji testnet and tokens were sent to different classmates' accounts.
- **ERC721 NFT Contract**:
  - Metadata for an NFT was created using Pinata (IPFS).
  - The contract was used to mint the NFT and send it to different classmates' accounts.
  - Metadata used in the NFT exercise: [NFT Metadata](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbvEmLnMwYgNxG1vRHADkwd34apZqSzRCQneEETNAmHSB)

## Learning Highlights

- **Differences Between ERC721 and ERC1155**: Learned about the unique features and use cases for each type of NFT.
- **OpenSea Testnet Marketplace**: Used to view the NFT from the contract and its properties.

## OpenZeppelin Features

The following features were added to the ERC721 contract:

- **Mintable**
- **Auto Increment IDs**
- **URI Storage**
