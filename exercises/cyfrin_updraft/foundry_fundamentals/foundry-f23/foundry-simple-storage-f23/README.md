# Foundry SimpleStorage Project

This repository contains my first project using Foundry, a powerful toolkit for testing and deploying Solidity smart contracts. This project was created following the Foundry Fundamentals course from Cyfrin Updraft. The goal of this project is to showcase the deployment and testing of a smart contract using Foundry's tools.

## Overview

In this project, we utilized the `SimpleStorage.sol` contract, which was originally created in the Solidity 101 course. Using this contract, we learned how to:

- **Simulate deployments:** We practiced deploying the contract in a simulated environment to understand the deployment process and identify any potential issues before deploying to a live network.
- **Create a local node:** Using Anvil, we set up a local Ethereum node to test our smart contracts in a controlled, local environment.
- **Utilize RPC URLs and private keys:** We configured the project to interact with the Ethereum network using RPC URLs and managed private keys securely.
- **Manage private keys with a keystore:** We learned how to securely store and use private keys using a keystore file, ensuring sensitive information is protected.
- **Interact with the contract via CLI:** Using Foundry's Cast tool, we sent transactions and called functions on the deployed contract from the command line.
- **Deploy to Sepolia testnet:** Finally, we used Alchemy to obtain an RPC URL and deployed the contract to the Sepolia testnet, gaining experience in deploying to a live network.

For those interested in replicating this project or diving deeper into Foundry and smart contract development, please refer to the original course repository: [Cyfrin Foundry Simple Storage Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-simple-storage-cu).

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the basic capabilities of Foundry for deploying and interacting with Solidity smart contracts. Following the steps outlined in the course, you can replicate the setup and deployment processes on your local machine and testnet environments.

Special thanks to Cyfrin Updraft and Patrick Collins for their excellent courses that guided this project.
